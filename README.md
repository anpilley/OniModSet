# OniModSet

A set of In-progress/personal mods for Oxygen Not Included,

## Grouped Resources
 Not even remotely functional yet, explodes basically immediately.

 ## Powerless Deodorizers. 
 Don't really want to have to run wires everywhere, like the good ole days.

 ## Improved Rocket Controls
 This improves crew behavior around rockets, providing grounded support for Atmosuit Checkpoints, and (in progress) functionality to limit access to a crew capsule to only include dupes on the Crew list.
